FeelsBookActivity is the main activity. That is where we create our Emotion and Counter objects.
Each Emotion object we create is stored in an ArrayList, and the Counter and Emotion ArrayList are 
accessible by ListActivity. The Emotion ArrayList and Counter are also saved with Gson.

In ListActivity, we create an Adapter to handle the ListView. The ListActivity uses our Emotion ArrayList in the adapter,
and modifies the ListView based on the Emotions in the ArrayList. 

Our Emotion class stores the emotion as a string, along with a date string and comment string.

Our Counter class holds a dictionary, where the Emotion string is the key, and the value is an integer of the number of that emotion.
We can call increment(emotion) to increment the value in the dictionary.
